Design Process
As a fan of these games, I want to have something from the game that i can take into real life so that i can show that i am a fan of it.
This website is for the fans of games produced by FauxMo Studios, it becomes easier to find like-minded people.
Merchandise is an easy and efficient way to bridge this gap between the game and the community that these fans wish to build.
In addition,these fans will wish to see more content and upcoming works from the creators, this website will allow for this and more as they will be allowed the oppurtunity to participate in the development of an upcoming game.
